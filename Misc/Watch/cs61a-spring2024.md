## The Non-Pure Print Function

- **Pure functions.** Functions have some input (their arguments) and return some output (the result of applying them).

- **Non-pure functions.** In addition to returning a value, applying a non-pure function can generate side effects, which make some change to the state of the interpreter or computer. A common side effect is to generate additional output beyond the return value, using the print function.
